    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective: February 21, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>Siraj</strong> ("the App") is developed by Forsan. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Siraj has no ads, no user accounts, and does not track you across apps or websites. We collect limited anonymous data to improve the app, as described below.</p>

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>The App requests location access solely to calculate accurate prayer times for your city. Your location is processed entirely on your device and is never sent to any external server. You may also choose a city manually without granting location access.</p>

    <h2>Analytics &amp; Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>Siraj uses Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, and Firebase Performance to understand how the app is used and to fix bugs. This data includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anonymous usage events (e.g. which features are opened, settings changed)</li>
        <li>Crash reports and performance metrics</li>
        <li>Device type and OS version</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is <strong>not linked to your identity</strong> — there are no user accounts, no names, no email addresses. It is used solely to improve the app and is never shared with advertisers or sold to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores your preferences (selected city, calculation method, fasting streak) locally on your device. This data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>StoreKit</h2>
    <p>If you choose to leave a tip via the App, the transaction is handled entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not receive or store any payment information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal data from children. Since all analytics data is anonymous and not linked to any individual, the App is safe for all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy, reach out on Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/forsan87">@forsan87</a>.</p>
